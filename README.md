# Bellyslaps

A repo full of a command-line guessing games written in multiple languages.

### Game setting

Jason is a hard-working developer who is constantly on the "go" (writing in Go, playing games of Go, constantly moving, ect.) He works hard during the day and winds down with Scotch in the evenings. How many Scotches he consumes is directly correlated to how his day has gone.

Can you guess how many Scotches for each day?

- Ruby
- Swift

With future plans for:
- Golang
- Python
- JavaScript

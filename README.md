# Bellyslaps

A repo full of a command-line number guessing games written in multiple languages.

### Game setting

Jason is a hard-working developer who is constantly on the "_Go_" (coding in _Go_, playing games of _Go_, constantly moving, ect.) He works hard during the day and winds down with Scotch in the evenings. How many Scotches he consumes is directly correlated to how his day has gone.

Can you guess how many Scotches for each day?

- [Swift](https://github.com/brentmartin/bellyslaps-command-line#swift)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/brentmartin/bellyslaps-command-line#ruby)

With future plans for:
- Golang

- JavaScript
